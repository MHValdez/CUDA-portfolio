# CUDA Performance Analysis using Monte Carlo Simulation

As detailed in [Projec5_valdemar.pdf](https://github.com/MHValdez/CUDA-portfolio/blob/main/Project5_valdemar.pdf), this project analyzes the performance of a small Monte Carlo style simulation of a randomized peg/hole fit test.
The tests were written in CUDA and run across multiple hardware configurations, including a workstation with a single consumer GPU, a server with a single commercial GPU, and a server with a commercial GPU array. Trials were scripted in Bash. These results were also compared to a similar test run in OpenMP on a workstation CPU.
